  <h1>Landslide</h1>
  <h2>Fleetwood Mac</h2>
  <p> I took my love, I took it down<br> I climbed a mountain and I turned around<br> And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills<br> 'Till the landslide brought me down<br>
    <br> Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?<br> Can the child within my heart rise above?<br> Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?<br> Can I handle the seasons of my life?<br>
    <br> Well, I've been afraid of changing<br> 'Cause I've built my life around you<br> But time makes you bolder<br> Even children get older<br> And I'm getting older too<br>
    <br> Well, I've been afraid of changing<br> 'Cause I've built my life around you<br> But time makes you bolder<br> Even children get older<br> And I'm getting older too<br> Oh, I'm getting older too<br>
    <br> Oh, take my love, take it down<br> Oh, climb a mountain and turn around<br> And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills<br> Well the landslide will bring it down<br> And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills<br> Well the
    landslide will bring it down, oh oh<br> The landslide will bring it down
    <br><br>
